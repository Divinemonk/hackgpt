# HackGPT

## Introductory Note
__HackGPT__ is a collective one place resource project that aims to unleash the _full potential_ of ChatGPT models by reverse engineering their prompts. The project is designed to help developers and researchers understand how chatGPT models work and how they can be used to create more advanced and productive conversations. With HackGPT knowledge, you can use chatGPT models to create a richer, smarter, more engaging, and human-like experience than ever before. And the best part? _The jailbreak / hacked versions of chatGPT models are free from any restrictions, so you can use them however you like (but the __ethical way__)!_ [GO TO [INDEX](#index)]

## Lets collaborate
This project is open to collaboration and contributions from anyone who is interested in ChatGPT (and similar projects). Whether youâ€™re a seasoned developer, hacker or just getting started with conversational AI, you can contribute to the project by submitting pull requests, reporting issues, or just sharing your ideas and feedback. With your help, we can make HackGPT the ultimate informational repo. So join us, fellow @hackers - @developers - all A.I. enthusiast, to share knowledge and unlock the next level!
